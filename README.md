## BioSim Project for INF200

This project is after demand from The Environmental Protection Agency of Pylandia (EPAP). 
The demand contains a simulation of the population dynamics on Rossumøya. The team consists
of Andrine Zimmermann and Karin Mollatt. 

Both Zimmermann and Mollatt are 2nd year students at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences,
studying Data Science. Their specialization is Health Care Informatics. 

### Rossumøya

Rossumøya belongs to Pylandia, and the ecosystem is relatively undisturbed. The built up 
by cells, and each cell is landscape type and may contain a population. 

### Landscapes

The different landscape types of Rossumøya are:

- Lowland
- Highland
- Desert
- Water

The different landscape types have different characteristics. The animals on Rossumøya 
cannot move into the water. The desert does not contain fodder for the herbivores, but the
animals can still move to these cells. The lowland and highland cells contain fodder for 
the herbivores, where lowland cells have more available fodder. 

### Animals

The different animal species of Rossumøya are:

- Herbivore
- Carnivore

Herbivores depend on how much fodder is available in the cells to survive and reproduce. 
Carnivores prey on the herbivores to survive and reproduce, but do not prey on each other.
